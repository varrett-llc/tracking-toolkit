Tracking Toolkit allows you to view and record [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) devices inside Blender
with NLA integration and [SMPTE timecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode).

It allows camera/object tracking with high degrees of clarity,
and can also track the movement of actors for motion capture.

You can view the [demonstration video](https://youtu.be/W6DTAmQiJ4Q) on YouTube. 
There is also a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/watch?v=wcLYXi85080) available.

If you'd like to see support for a new device, let me know! You can open an issue for any questions.

## Requirements

Tracking Toolkit works with Blender 5.3 or later.

Additionally, you will need an OpenXR runtime and a device to go with it.

| Runtime   | Example Devices           |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| SteamVR   | Valve Index, HTC VIVE     |
| Meta Link | Meta Quest 3, Oculus Rift |
| VDXR      | Meta Quest 3, Vive Focus  |
| Monado    | Open Source/Community     |

## Installation

1) Download `tracking_toolkit-latest.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ethanporcaro/tracking-toolkit/releases/latest)
2) Open Blender, use `Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions > (Arrow in top right corner) > Install from disk`, and select the downloaded zip.

## Usage

1) Navigate to the new "Track TK" tab on the sidebar.


2) Press the `Start/Connect OpenXR` button to establish a connection to your runtime. 
If your runtime is not open, it will be launched. 
The list below will populate with names of detected controllers/trackers.


3) Press `Create References` to add the detected trackers to your scene. 
This will create bones, but you can toggle the checkbox to create empties instead.


4) At this point, a large `Start Recording` button will be visible. 
When pressed, it will record the tracker's positions until you press stop.
Existing recordings will be pushed down onto a new NLA strip and muted.
You can also set an optional delay timer.

## Additional Information

<details>

<summary>Tracker List</summary>

### Tracker List

When new trackers are detected, they will appear on the list.
You can press `Create References` again to add them to the scene.

Even if controllers are disconnected, they will still remain on the list.

You can click the eyeball icon to show and hide the trackers in the viewport.

> ⚠️ If you are using Vive Trackers, you will need to use SteamVR as your OpenXR runtime. 
> You will also need to assign a role to each tracker (waist, foot, etc.) in the SteamVR tracker settings.

You can double click a tracker's name on the list to give it a nickname.
You should not directly rename empties or bones in the outliner.

You can also set nicknames in the addon preferences that apply to all future files.

<details>

<summary>References</summary>

### References

References represent your tracker in the scene.

These will either be bones in an armature, or empties. 
You can toggle `Use Bones For Trackers` checkbox at any time to change this.
All your existing takes/actions will be converted.

Each tracker will have two references:

* The tracking point will follow the tracker's exact location in 3D space. 
It will have the keyframe data when recording.
Generally, it should be left untouched, as data will be overwritten when recording.

* The offset point is a child of the tracking point. 
It receives no data, and should be used for tweaking/aligning the tracker.
Objects or cameras in your scene should be constrained to this offset, rather than the tracking point.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Recording</summary>

### Recording

By default, trackers will be recorded at your scene's FPS.
You can override this in the addon preferences.

High FPS values may cause performance issues, or prevent the recording from reflecting true tracker positions.

There is a dropdown below the record button that allows you to set a delay before data is captured.

Each time you record a new take, old ones are pushed down onto new NLA strips and muted.
The action's name will be a [SMPTE timecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode]) 
(prefixed with the tracker's name if using empties).

</details>

## Troubleshooting

Here are the solutions for common problems. 
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ethanporcaro/tracking-toolkit/issues/new) if you have additional questions or problems.

* Disconnecting and reconnecting OpenXR with the button at the top of the Tracking Toolkit will often solve minor issues.
* Restarting Blender and/or your runtime also fixes many common problems.
* Manual changes to the reference objects, bones, and names can cause issues. 
You may need to start with a fresh scene in those cases.

<summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>

### FAQ

**Q:** How many trackers do I need?

**A:** You only need 1 to get started, but you'll need more for things like full-body motion capture.

**Q:** Can I view my scene in VR?

**A:** Yes! Do note that complex scenes or render modes may cause performance issues.

**Q:** Can I only use Vive Trackers without a headset?

**A:** Yes! Make sure to disable `Pause VR when headset is idle` in the SteamVR video settings. 
If you have no headset attached at all, you may need to enable the Mock HMD driver.

**Q:** Will my scene animations play during recording?

**A:** No. That may change in the future if needed.
